An issue was discovered in Nagios XI 5.8.8 or earlier.

### Vulnerability: 
Account takeover due to lack of password confirmation on e-mail change

### Description:
Because no password verification is done while changing the e-mail address of an valid account, it is possible to take over NagiosXI accounts if an attacker has control over a workplace and a valid NagiosXI session is active on it. 

### Attack Scenario:
1. From an attacker controlling a victim's workplace, go to http://nagios_host/nagiosxi/account/main.php 
2. Change the email address to an address that the attacker can control 
3. Click the "Update Settings" button 
4. The attacker goes to http://nagios_host/nagiosxi/login.php?forgotpass and enters the attacker's email address 
5. The attacker will receive a password reset link on his email 
6. The attacker resets the victim's password via the password-reset link, the account has been taken over. 

### Mitigation:
To mitigate this vulnerability, update Nagios to version 5.8.9 or later. See also https://www.nagios.com/downloads/nagios-xi/change-log/
