An issue was discovered in Nagios XI 5.8.8 or earlier.

### Vulnerability: 
Open redirect at login function

### Description:
Because no validation is done on the redirect paramater in the login.php file, an open redirect is possible.

### Attack Scenario:
1. Go to the URL: https://nagios_host/nagiosxi/login.php?redirect=\/www.example.com
2. Log in to Nagios
3. The user gets redirected to www.example.com, which proves the open redirect

### Mitigation:
To mitigate this vulnerability, update Nagios to version 5.8.9 or later. See also https://www.nagios.com/downloads/nagios-xi/change-log/
